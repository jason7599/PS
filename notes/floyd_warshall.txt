an algorithm that maps the shortest distance between ALL pairs of nodes in a graph

"If I stop at another city on the way, could I make my trip shorter?"

tests all possible stops in between and updates its shortest route every time it finds a shorter way

1. start with a distance matrix
- initially... :
- each cell in the table denotes the DIRECT distance between 2 nodes
- no direct edge -> infinity

2. for each pair of cities, check if stopping at A THIRD NODE makes the trip shorter.
- update the table if it does.

3. repeat until no more updates

Why does this work?
=> it improves routes by combining smaller, already-known routes.
