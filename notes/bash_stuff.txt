apparently whitespaces are not allowed when assigning values to variables.
    i = 5 gives an error.
    i=5 works.

getting the i-th character of a string:
    "${str:$i:1}"
    the 1 in the 3rd parameter denotes how many characters.

$((...)) is the arithmetic operator.
    a=$((b*9))

length of a string:
    ${#str}
